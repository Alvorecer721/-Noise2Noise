# EE559-DL-Miniprojects



Code repository for EPFL EE559 Deep learning mini-projects, the goal of the mini-projects is to implement a Noise2Noise model. 

The project has two parts, focusing on two diﬀerent facets of deep learning:
* The ﬁrst one is to build a network that denoises using the PyTorch framework, in particular the `torch.nn` modules and autograd. 
* The second one is to understand and build a framework from scratch, its constituent modules, that are the standard building blocks of deep networks without PyTorch’s autograd.
